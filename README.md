# main-branch

The [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) points out] (https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-knodel-terminology-00.html#rfc.section.1.1.1) that "Master-slave is an oppressive metaphor that will and should never become fully detached from history" as well as "In addition to being inappropriate and arcane, the [master-slave metaphor] (https://github.com/bitkeeper-scm/bitkeeper/blob/master/doc/HOWTO.ask?WT.mc_id=-blog-scottha#L231-L232) is both technically and historically inaccurate." There's lots of more accurate options depending on context and it costs me nothing to change my vocabulary, especially if it is one less little speed bump to getting a new person excited about tech.

So, in this project, main branch is "main" instead of master. LOL.
